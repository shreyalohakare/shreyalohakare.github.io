            <p>Nestled in a charming corner of downtown, La Bella Italia has been serving authentic Italian cuisine for over two decades. As soon as you step through the rustic wooden doors, you're transported to a cozy trattoria in Rome, complete with checkered tablecloths and the warm aroma of fresh herbs and garlic.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>The restaurant's ambiance strikes the perfect balance between elegant and comfortable. Soft lighting from vintage chandeliers creates an intimate atmosphere, while the exposed brick walls and wooden beams add rustic charm. The gentle sounds of Italian music playing in the background complete the immersive experience.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Signature Dishes</h2>
            
            <div class="dish-review">
                <h3 class="dish-title">Homemade Fettuccine Alfredo</h3>
                <div class="dish-rating">★★★★★ (5/5)</div>
                <p>The pasta is made fresh daily, resulting in perfectly al dente fettuccine ribbons. The Alfredo sauce is creamy without being heavy, with just the right amount of Parmigiano-Reggiano.</p>
                <p class="price">Price: $24</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dish-review">
                <h3 class="dish-title">Osso Buco alla Milanese</h3>
                <div class="dish-rating">★★★★½ (4.5/5)</div>
                <p>This slow-cooked veal shank is fall-off-the-bone tender, served with traditional gremolata and saffron risotto. The rich, wine-based sauce is absolutely divine.</p>
                <p class="price">Price: $38</p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="section-title">Wine Selection</h2>
            <p>The wine list is extensive and thoughtfully curated, featuring both renowned and boutique Italian wineries. The sommelier is knowledgeable and happy to recommend perfect pairings for your meal.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Service</h2>
            <p>The staff's attention to detail and warm hospitality make dining here a truly memorable experience. They strike the perfect balance between attentiveness and allowing you to enjoy your meal in peace.</p>
